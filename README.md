Hi I'm Dmitry and I'm a Structural Engineer in New Zealand. I like to make scripts and code up software to make Engineers' and Clients' lives easier.

Main passion is linking up existing softwares to use them together where possible to speed up the design process and provide more design options for clients to
consider quicker. It is highly rewarding when software is used to quickly iterate and find an optimal solution that suits their preferences.

Interests are:
- Excel and its API via Excel-DNA and C#
- Revit and its API via C#
- Have also done plenty of work with Python, Angular2 and TypeScript

Other interests and things I want to learn and improve on:
- SAP2000 and ETABS APIs
- Dynamo and Custom Nodes via C#
- LaTeX
- Haskell and other functional languages
- +many more
